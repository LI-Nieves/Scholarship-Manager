GUI:

If not running in ECLIPSE:

javac Guii.java

java Guii

I ran this file on eclipse, i would prefer running this file in eclipse.
In order to compile the files, please put the following files into the same folder:

- AfterLogin.java
- Guii.java
- Register.java
- Coordinator.java
- Scholarship.java
- StartGui.java
- Student.java
- studentClass.java
- User.java

As well as:

- rsz_usask.png
- sask.jpg
- usask.png
- UserInfoDatabase.txt

After doing this run the Guii.java file.
Right now the login button works and the register button.
By pressing the register button it will prompt for your name and other details.
As of right now thats all that has been implemented for the register part.

By pressing the login button, you the program will try to log you in. 
But correct login information is needed. For now you can look inside the UserInfoDatabasetxt
and choose one of the login usernames and password.
You will also have to check the correct role, if your a student or a Coordinator.

Once this has been done if you login in, you will be taken to a new Panel, which has not
been fully implemented yet.

As of now we are trying to implement the back end and have the code working.
We are getting closer and closer to finishing this, once done we will fully implement
these functions into the GUI. As of now we have started a little bit of the GUI, and 
have been focusing more on implementing the classes and funcitonality.
